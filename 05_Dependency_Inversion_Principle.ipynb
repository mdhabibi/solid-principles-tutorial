        "**Don't hardcode dependencies inside your classes. Instead, let other classes pass in what they need.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like this: instead of a class creating its own tools, it should receive the tools it needs from the outside. This makes your code more flexible and easier to test.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **The Problem:**\n",
        "When a class creates its own dependencies, it becomes \"stuck\" to those specific implementations. It's like a chef who only knows how to cook with one specific brand of knife - if that knife breaks, the chef can't cook anymore.\n",

        "### **The Solution:**\n",
        "Instead of creating dependencies inside the class, pass them in from the outside. This is like giving the chef any knife that can cut - they can work with different brands, different types, even different tools as long as they can cut.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why This Matters:**\n",
        "- **Testing**: You can easily test your code by passing in \"fake\" versions of dependencies\n",

        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",

        "\n",
        "### Dependency Inversion Principle Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Depend on abstractions**: High-level modules should depend on interfaces, not concrete classes\n",
        "2. **Dependency injection**: Inject dependencies rather than creating them internally\n",
        "3. **Inversion of control**: Let external code control the dependencies\n",
        "4. **Loose coupling**: High-level and low-level modules are decoupled through abstractions\n",
        "5. **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations without changing high-level code\n",
        "\n",
        "### When DIP is violated:\n",
        "- High-level modules directly instantiate low-level modules\n",
        "- Classes create their own dependencies internally\n",
        "- Hard to test because dependencies can't be mocked\n",
        "- Difficult to change implementations without modifying high-level code\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to apply DIP:\n",
        "- **Create abstractions**: Define interfaces for dependencies\n",
        "- **Use dependency injection**: Pass dependencies through constructor or methods\n",
        "- **Avoid `new` in business logic**: Don't create objects inside business methods\n",
        "- **Use dependency injection containers**: For complex dependency management\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of DIP:\n",
        "- ✅ **Easy testing**: Can inject mock objects for unit testing\n",
        "- ✅ **Flexible configuration**: Different implementations for different environments\n",
        "- ✅ **Maintainable code**: Changes to low-level modules don't affect high-level modules\n",
        "- ✅ **Extensible design**: Easy to add new implementations\n",
        "\n",
        "### Design patterns that help with DIP:\n",
        "- **Dependency Injection**: Inject dependencies rather than creating them\n",
        "- **Factory Pattern**: Create objects without specifying exact classes\n",
        "- **Service Locator**: Find and inject services\n",
        "- **Inversion of Control (IoC) containers**: Manage dependencies automatically\n",
