        "# 📘 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "**Don't force classes to implement methods they don't need. Instead, create smaller, focused interfaces.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like this: instead of creating one big \"Swiss Army knife\" interface that has everything, create separate, specialized interfaces. Each class should only implement the methods it actually needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🎯 What This Means in Simple Terms\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The Basic Idea:**\n",
        "When you create an interface (or abstract class), it should only contain methods that all classes implementing it will actually use. If some classes don't need certain methods, those methods shouldn't be in the interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Real-World Analogy:**\n",
        "Imagine you're designing tools for different jobs:\n",
        "- **Bad**: One \"Universal Tool\" interface that includes hammer, screwdriver, saw, and paintbrush methods\n",
        "- **Good**: Separate interfaces - \"HammerInterface\", \"ScrewdriverInterface\", \"SawInterface\", \"PaintbrushInterface\"\n",
        "\n",
        "A carpenter only needs hammer and saw methods, not paintbrush methods!\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The Key Rule:**\n",
        "**No class should be forced to implement methods it doesn't use. If a method isn't needed, it shouldn't be in the interface.**\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🔍 Why ISP Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Without ISP (Problems):**\n",
        "- **Forced implementations**: Classes must implement methods they don't need\n",
        "- **Useless code**: Classes end up with empty methods or \"NotImplementedError\"\n",
        "- **Tight coupling**: Classes depend on methods they don't use\n",
        "- **Hard to maintain**: Changes to unused methods affect all classes\n",
        "- **Confusing interfaces**: Big interfaces are hard to understand\n",
        "\n",
        "### **With ISP (Benefits):**\n",
        "- **Focused interfaces**: Each interface has a clear, single purpose\n",
        "- **No forced implementations**: Classes only implement what they need\n",
        "- **Loose coupling**: Classes depend only on methods they use\n",
        "- **Easy to maintain**: Changes to one interface don't affect others\n",
        "- **Clear contracts**: Small interfaces are easy to understand\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🚨 Common ISP Violations\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Fat Interfaces (Too Many Methods):**\n",
        "- Interface: \"Shape\" with methods: area(), volume(), draw(), save(), email()\n",
        "- Problem: 2D shapes don't need volume(), simple shapes don't need email()\n",
        "- Result: Classes must implement methods they don't need\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Mixed Responsibilities:**\n",
        "- Interface: \"UserManager\" with methods: create_user(), send_email(), save_to_database(), generate_report()\n",
        "- Problem: Email service doesn't need user creation, database doesn't need email sending\n",
        "- Result: Classes implement unrelated methods\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Forced Dependencies:**\n",
        "- Interface: \"Vehicle\" with methods: start_engine(), fly(), swim(), dive()\n",
        "- Problem: Cars don't fly, planes don't swim, boats don't dive\n",
        "- Result: Classes throw \"NotImplementedError\" for methods they can't use\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Interface Pollution:**\n",
        "- Interface: \"FileHandler\" with methods: read(), write(), compress(), encrypt(), backup(), restore()\n",
        "- Problem: Simple file readers don't need encryption, backup tools don't need compression\n",
        "- Result: Classes become bloated with unused functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "## 💡 How to Apply ISP\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 1: Identify Client Needs**\n",
        "- Ask: \"What methods does this specific class actually need?\"\n",
        "- Don't think: \"What methods might be useful someday?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 2: Split Large Interfaces**\n",
        "- Break big interfaces into smaller, focused ones\n",
        "- Each interface should have a single, clear responsibility\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 3: Use Composition**\n",
        "- Classes can implement multiple small interfaces\n",
        "- This gives flexibility without forcing unused methods\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 4: Keep Interfaces Focused**\n",
        "- Each interface should have 1-3 related methods\n",
        "- If an interface has more than 5 methods, consider splitting it\n",
        "\n",

        "### Interface Segregation Principle Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Focused interfaces**: Create small, focused interfaces instead of large, bloated ones\n",
        "2. **No forced dependencies**: Clients should only depend on methods they actually use\n",
        "3. **Composition over inheritance**: Use multiple small interfaces instead of one large interface\n",
        "4. **Avoid NotImplementedError**: Classes shouldn't be forced to implement methods they can't use\n",
        "5. **Better cohesion**: Group related methods together in focused interfaces\n",
        "\n",
        "### When ISP is violated:\n",
        "- Interfaces contain methods that not all implementing classes need\n",
        "- Classes throw `NotImplementedError` for methods they can't implement\n",
        "- Changes to one method affect many unrelated classes\n",
        "- Interfaces become bloated with unrelated functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to apply ISP:\n",
        "- **Identify responsibilities**: Break down large interfaces into smaller, focused ones\n",
        "- **Use composition**: Allow classes to implement multiple small interfaces\n",
        "- **Client-specific interfaces**: Create interfaces based on what clients actually need\n",
        "- **Avoid fat interfaces**: Don't put everything in one interface\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of ISP:\n",
        "- ✅ **Reduced coupling**: Classes only depend on what they use\n",
        "- ✅ **Better maintainability**: Changes are isolated to relevant classes\n",
        "- ✅ **Improved flexibility**: Classes can implement only what they need\n",
        "- ✅ **Cleaner code**: Smaller interfaces are easier to understand and implement\n",
