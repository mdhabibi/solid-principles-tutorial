        "## Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "**Add new features by writing new code, not by changing existing code.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like this: your existing code is like a solid foundation - you don't want to tear it down every time you need to add something new. Instead, you build on top of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "## üéØ What This Means in Simple Terms\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The Basic Idea:**\n",
        "When you need to add new functionality, you should **extend** your existing code (add new classes, methods, or modules) rather than **modify** it (change existing classes, methods, or modules).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Real-World Analogy:**\n",
        "Imagine you have a house and want to add a new room:\n",
        "- **Bad**: Tear down existing walls and rebuild everything (modification)\n",
        "- **Good**: Build a new room attached to the existing house (extension)\n",
        "\n",
        "The existing house stays the same, but you get the new functionality you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The Key Rule:**\n",
        "**If you need new behavior, add new code. Don't change old code.**\n",
        "\n",
        "## üîç Why OCP Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Without OCP (Problems):**\n",
        "- **Breaking changes**: Adding new features breaks existing functionality\n",
        "- **Risky modifications**: Every change to existing code is a potential source of bugs\n",
        "- **Testing nightmare**: You have to retest everything when you modify existing code\n",
        "- **Unstable codebase**: Existing code keeps changing, making it hard to rely on\n",
        "- **Cascade failures**: One small change can break multiple parts of the system\n",
        "\n",
        "### **With OCP (Benefits):**\n",
        "- **Stable foundation**: Existing code doesn't change, so it stays reliable\n",
        "- **Safe additions**: New features are added without touching existing code\n",
        "- **Isolated changes**: Problems with new code don't affect existing functionality\n",
        "- **Easy testing**: Existing tests continue to work without modification\n",
        "- **Confident development**: You can add features without fear of breaking things\n",
        "\n",
        "## üö® Common OCP Violations\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Modifying Existing Classes:**\n",
        "- **Problem**: Adding new features by changing existing class methods\n",
        "- **Example**: Adding new shape types by modifying the existing `AreaCalculator` class\n",
        "- **Result**: Existing code becomes unstable and hard to maintain\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Hard-coded Logic:**\n",
        "- **Problem**: Using if/else statements to handle different types\n",
        "- **Example**: `if shape_type == \"circle\": ... elif shape_type == \"rectangle\": ...`\n",
        "- **Result**: Every new type requires modifying existing code\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Tight Coupling:**\n",
        "- **Problem**: Classes are tightly connected to specific implementations\n",
        "- **Example**: A class that directly creates specific types of objects\n",
        "- **Result**: Adding new types requires changing the class that creates them\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Monolithic Classes:**\n",
        "- **Problem**: One big class that handles everything\n",
        "- **Example**: A single class that processes all types of shapes\n",
        "- **Result**: Adding new functionality requires modifying the big class\n",
        "\n",
        "## üí° How to Apply OCP\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 1: Use Abstraction**\n",
        "- Create abstract base classes or interfaces\n",
        "- Define common behavior that can be extended\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 2: Use Inheritance**\n",
        "- Create new classes that inherit from existing ones\n",
        "- Override or extend methods as needed\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 3: Use Composition**\n",
        "- Compose objects together instead of modifying existing ones\n",
        "- Add new functionality through new components\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 4: Use Strategy Pattern**\n",
        "- Define algorithms as separate classes\n",
        "- Switch between different implementations without changing existing code\n",

        "\n",
        "### Open/Closed Principle Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Open for extension**: New functionality can be added through inheritance, composition, or other extension mechanisms\n",
        "2. **Closed for modification**: Existing code should not be modified when adding new features\n",
        "3. **Use abstractions**: Abstract base classes or interfaces enable extension without modification\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**: Common interfaces allow different implementations to work together\n",
        "5. **Stability**: Existing functionality remains unchanged and stable\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to apply OCP:\n",
        "- When you frequently need to add new types or behaviors\n",
        "- When modifying existing code risks breaking working functionality\n",
        "- When you want to maintain backward compatibility\n",
        "- When you need to support multiple implementations of the same concept\n",
        "\n",
        "### Design patterns that help with OCP:\n",
        "- **Strategy Pattern**: Different algorithms for the same task\n",
        "- **Template Method Pattern**: Common structure with customizable steps\n",
        "- **Factory Pattern**: Creating objects without specifying exact classes\n",
        "- **Decorator Pattern**: Adding behavior without modifying existing classes\n",
        "\n",
