> A comprehensive tool for analyzing and assessing code quality based on SOLID design principles, with interactive tutorials and automated analysis capabilities.

## üéØ What is SOLID Inspector?

SOLID Inspector is a powerful tool that helps developers:
- **üîç Analyze** code for SOLID principle violations
- **üìö Learn** SOLID principles through interactive tutorials
- **üõ†Ô∏è Refactor** code with intelligent suggestions
- **üìà Improve** code quality and maintainability

## üìñ Educational Tutorials

This repository includes comprehensive Jupyter notebook tutorials covering all 5 SOLID principles. These tutorials serve as both learning materials and documentation for understanding how the SOLID Inspector analyzes code.

The SOLID principles are fundamental guidelines for writing maintainable, flexible, and robust object-oriented code. These tutorials will help you understand not just *what* these principles are, but *why* they matter and *how* to apply them effectively.

## üìñ What You'll Learn

By completing this tutorial series, you will:

- ‚úÖ **Understand** each SOLID principle and its importance
- ‚úÖ **Identify** violations of SOLID principles in existing code
- ‚úÖ **Apply** SOLID principles to design better software architecture
- ‚úÖ **Refactor** code to follow SOLID principles
- ‚úÖ **Write** more maintainable, testable, and flexible code
- ‚úÖ **Recognize** when and how to use design patterns that support SOLID principles

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Using uv (Recommended - Fastest) ‚ö°

> **Why uv?** uv is a modern, extremely fast Python package manager written in Rust. It's 10-100x faster than pip and provides better dependency resolution.

1. **Install uv** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   # On macOS and Linux
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   
   # On Windows
   powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   
   # Or via pip
   pip install uv
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdhabibi/solid-design-principles.git
   cd solid-design-principles
   ```

3. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   **Alternative one-liner with uv:**
   ```bash
   uv run --with jupyter --with notebook --with ipykernel --with numpy --with pandas --with matplotlib --with seaborn --with pytest jupyter notebook
   ```

   **Or even simpler with uv:**
   ```bash
   uv run jupyter notebook
   ```

### Option 2: Using Conda

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdhabibi/solid-design-principles.git
   cd solid-design-principles
   ```

2. **Create and activate conda environment**
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate solid-design-principles
   ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

### Option 3: Using pip

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdhabibi/solid-design-principles.git
   cd solid-design-principles
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv solid-env
   source solid-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: solid-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## üéì Learning Path

### For Beginners
1. Start with the [Overview](00_SOLID_Principles_Overview.ipynb) to understand the big picture
2. Work through each principle notebook in order (01 ‚Üí 05)
3. Run all code examples to see the principles in action
4. Try the exercises to reinforce your understanding

### Using the SOLID Inspector CLI
```bash
# Install the package
pip install -e .

# Analyze code for SOLID violations
solid-inspector analyze examples/bad_example.py

# Launch tutorials
solid-inspector tutorial

# Start interactive mode
solid-inspector interactive
```

### Compare Examples
- **Bad Examples**: `examples/bad_example.py` - Contains SOLID violations
- **Good Examples**: `examples/good_example.py` - Proper SOLID implementation

### For Intermediate Developers
1. Skip to specific principles you want to focus on
2. Compare the "bad" vs "good" examples to understand the differences
3. Experiment with the code to see how changes affect the design
4. Apply the principles to your own projects

### For Advanced Developers
1. Use this as a reference for teaching others
2. Focus on the testing examples to understand how SOLID principles improve testability
3. Explore the design patterns mentioned in each notebook
4. Contribute improvements and additional examples

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+** - Basic understanding of Python syntax
- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Familiarity with classes, inheritance, and methods
- **Jupyter Notebook** - For running the interactive examples
- **Abstract Base Classes** - Basic understanding of ABC (explained in the notebooks)
