        "# üìö SOLID Design Principles - Complete Guide\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This collection of notebooks provides a comprehensive guide to the **SOLID design principles** in Python. Each principle is explained with clear definitions, practical examples, and hands-on exercises.\n",
        "\n",
        "## üéØ Our Example: Shape Management System\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this tutorial, we'll use a **consistent example** to demonstrate all SOLID principles: a **Shape Management System**. This approach helps you see how the principles work together in a real-world scenario.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What We're Building:**\n",
        "A system that manages different geometric shapes (rectangles, circles, triangles, etc.) and provides various operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **üìê Shape Operations**: Calculate areas, volumes, perimeters\n",
        "- **üíæ Data Persistence**: Save shapes to files (text, JSON, database)\n",
        "- **üìß Notifications**: Send email/SMS alerts about shape operations\n",
        "- **üé® Visualization**: Draw shapes on screen or export images\n",
        "- **üîÑ Processing**: Handle both 2D and 3D shapes\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why This Example Works:**\n",
        "- **Relatable**: Everyone understands shapes and their properties\n",
        "- **Scalable**: Easy to add new shapes and operations\n",
        "- **Realistic**: Mirrors real software systems with multiple responsibilities\n",
        "- **Progressive**: Starts simple, becomes more complex as we apply principles\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The Journey:**\n",
        "We'll start with **messy, hard-to-maintain code** and progressively apply each SOLID principle to transform it into **clean, maintainable architecture**. By the end, you'll have a complete system that demonstrates all five principles working together.\n",
        "\n",
        "## üìñ Notebook Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](01_Single_Responsibility_Principle.ipynb)\n",
        "- **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change\n",
        "- **Focus**: Separation of concerns and single responsibility\n",
        "- **What you'll learn**: How to avoid creating \"god classes\" that do everything\n",
        "- **Real example**: A class that calculates areas AND saves files AND sends emails (bad) vs separate classes for each task (good)\n",
        "- **Why it matters**: Makes code easier to test, maintain, and understand\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](02_Open_Closed_Principle.ipynb)\n",
        "- **Definition**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification\n",
        "- **Focus**: Extensibility without modification\n",
        "- **What you'll learn**: How to add new features without breaking existing code\n",
        "- **Real example**: Adding new shapes (Triangle, Pentagon) without modifying the area calculator\n",
        "- **Why it matters**: Prevents bugs when adding new functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](03_Liskov_Substitution_Principle.ipynb)\n",
        "- **Definition**: Subclasses should be able to replace their parent classes\n",
        "- **Focus**: Proper inheritance and substitutability\n",
        "- **What you'll learn**: How to design inheritance that actually works\n",
        "- **Real example**: A Square that inherits from Rectangle breaks when you try to set width=5 and height=3 (it becomes 3x3 instead of 5x3)\n",
        "- **Why it matters**: Ensures your inheritance makes logical sense and doesn't surprise users\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](04_Interface_Segregation_Principle.ipynb)\n",
        "- **Definition**: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they don't use\n",
        "- **Focus**: Focused, cohesive interfaces\n",
        "- **What you'll learn**: How to create focused interfaces instead of bloated ones\n",
        "- **Real example**: A Circle (2D shape) being forced to implement volume() method and throwing \"NotImplementedError\" because circles don't have volume\n",
        "- **Why it matters**: Prevents unnecessary complexity and forced implementations that don't make sense\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](05_Dependency_Inversion_Principle.ipynb)\n",
        "- **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules\n",
        "- **Focus**: Dependency injection and abstraction\n",
        "- **What you'll learn**: How to make your code flexible and testable\n",
        "- **Real example**: A ShapePrinter that directly creates AreaCalculator(shapes) inside its constructor, making it impossible to test or swap calculators\n",
        "- **Why it matters**: Makes testing easier and allows swapping implementations without changing the main code\n",
        "\n",
        "## üéØ Learning Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this series, you will understand:\n",

        "- **Why** each principle matters for maintainable code\n",
        "- **How** to identify violations of each principle\n",
        "- **When** to apply each principle in real-world scenarios\n",
        "- **What** benefits each principle provides\n",
        "- **How** to refactor code to follow SOLID principles\n",

        "Imagine you're building a system to manage different shapes (rectangles, circles, triangles, etc.) and need to:\n",

        "- Save them to files\n",
        "- Send notifications about them\n",
        "- Draw them on screen\n",
        "- Handle both 2D and 3D shapes\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The Journey:**\n",
        "1. **Start with messy code** - One big class doing everything (violates all principles)\n",
        "2. **Apply SRP** - Split into focused classes (AreaCalculator, FileSaver, Notifier)\n",
        "3. **Apply OCP** - Add new shapes without changing existing code\n",
        "4. **Apply LSP** - Fix inheritance problems (Square vs Rectangle)\n",
        "5. **Apply ISP** - Create focused interfaces (2D vs 3D shapes)\n",
        "6. **Apply DIP** - Make everything flexible and testable\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Real Code You'll Write:**\n",
        "```python\n",
