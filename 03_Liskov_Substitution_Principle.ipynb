        "# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "**If you can use a parent class somewhere, you should be able to use any of its child classes in the same place without breaking anything.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like this: if you have a \"Vehicle\" class and a \"Car\" class that inherits from it, then anywhere in your code where you expect a Vehicle, you should be able to use a Car instead. The Car should behave like a Vehicle, not surprise you with unexpected behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What This Means in Simple Terms\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The Basic Idea:**\n",
        "When you create a child class (subclass), it should be a \"drop-in replacement\" for its parent class. If your code works with the parent, it should work exactly the same way with the child.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Real-World Analogy:**\n",
        "Imagine you have a \"Pet\" class and a \"Dog\" class that inherits from Pet:\n",
        "- **Good**: A Dog IS a Pet, so anywhere you need a Pet, a Dog should work perfectly\n",
        "- **Bad**: A Dog that inherits from Pet but can't eat pet food (breaks the Pet contract)\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The Key Rule:**\n",
        "**A child class should do everything the parent class can do, and maybe more, but never less or differently in a surprising way.**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why LSP Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Without LSP (Problems):**\n",
        "- **Unexpected behavior**: Code breaks when you use child classes\n",
        "- **Hard to debug**: Things work with parent but fail with child\n",
        "- **Inheritance confusion**: You can't trust that inheritance actually works\n",
        "- **Code fragility**: Changes to child classes break existing code\n",
        "\n",
        "### **With LSP (Benefits):**\n",
        "- **Reliability**: Code that works with parent classes will work with subclasses\n",
        "- **Polymorphism**: You can safely use different types interchangeably\n",
        "- **Maintainability**: Changes to subclasses don't break existing code\n",
        "- **Design integrity**: Your inheritance relationships make logical sense\n",
        "\n",
        "## üö® Common LSP Violations\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Weakening Preconditions:**\n",
        "- Parent: \"This method works with any positive number\"\n",
        "- Child: \"This method only works with numbers between 1-10\"\n",
        "- **Problem**: Child is more restrictive than parent\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Strengthening Postconditions (Side Effects):**\n",
        "- Parent: \"This method returns a number\"\n",
        "- Child: \"This method returns a number AND sends an email\"\n",
        "- **Problem**: Child does the same thing PLUS unexpected side effects (sending email)\n",
        "- **Why it's bad**: The parent promised \"just return a number,\" but child also sends emails\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Changing Expected Behavior (Side Effects):**\n",
        "- Parent: \"This method calculates area\"\n",
        "- Child: \"This method calculates area AND changes the shape's size\"\n",
        "- **Problem**: Child does the same thing PLUS unexpected side effects (changing size)\n",
        "- **Why it's bad**: The parent promised \"just calculate area,\" but child also modifies the object\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Throwing New Exceptions:**\n",
        "- Parent: \"This method never throws exceptions\"\n",
        "- Child: \"This method throws exceptions in some cases\"\n",
        "- **Problem**: Child is less reliable than parent\n",
        "\n",
        "### **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Clarification: \"More\" vs. \"Different\"**\n",
        "When we say \"maybe more,\" we mean **additional helpful features**, not **changing the core behavior**. Here's the difference:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **‚úÖ Good \"More\" (Allowed):**\n",
        "- **Additional methods**: Child adds new methods that don't interfere with parent's behavior\n",
        "- **Enhanced functionality**: Child provides extra features while maintaining parent's contract\n",
        "- **Better performance**: Child does the same thing but faster or more efficiently\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **‚ùå Bad \"More\" (Violates LSP):**\n",
        "- **Side effects**: Child does the same thing PLUS unexpected side effects\n",
        "- **Changed behavior**: Child does something different than what the parent promised\n",
        "- **Broken contracts**: Child violates the parent's promises about what methods do\n",
        "\n",
        "### ** Concrete Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Calculator:\n",
        "    def add(self, a, b):\n",
        "        return a + b  # Just returns the sum\n",

        "        return result\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why SmartCalculator is OK**: It does the same thing (returns sum) PLUS helpful logging\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Substitutability**: Subclasses must be able to replace parent classes without breaking functionality\n",
        "2. **Behavioral consistency**: Subclasses should maintain the same behavior and contracts as parent classes\n",
        "3. **No unexpected exceptions**: Subclasses shouldn't throw exceptions that parent classes don't\n",
        "4. **Proper inheritance**: Only inherit when the relationship makes logical sense\n",
        "5. **Contract preservation**: All methods should work as expected when called on subclasses\n",
        "\n",
        "### When LSP is violated:\n",
        "- Subclasses change the behavior of inherited methods in unexpected ways\n",
        "- Subclasses throw exceptions that parent classes don't\n",
        "- Client code breaks when using subclasses instead of parent classes\n",
        "- Inheritance relationships don't make logical sense\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to ensure LSP compliance:\n",
        "- **Design by contract**: Clearly define what each method should do\n",
        "- **Use proper abstractions**: Create interfaces that make logical sense\n",
        "- **Test substitutability**: Write tests that verify subclasses work in place of parent classes\n",
        "- **Avoid inheritance when inappropriate**: Sometimes composition is better than inheritance\n",
